# Tasks

0. Rectangle #0

Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class

1. Rectangle #1

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h

2. Rectangle #2

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object

3. Rectangle #3

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X

4. Rectangle #4

Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:

You must use the class notation for defining your class
The constructor must take 2 arguments: w and h
Initialize the instance attribute width with the value of w
Initialize the instance attribute height with the value of h
If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object
Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X
Create an instance method called rotate() that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle
Create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2

5. Square #0

Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of 4-rectangle.js:

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
The constructor must take 1 argument: size
The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super())

6. Square #1

Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js:

You must use the class notation for defining your class and extends
Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c
If c is undefined, use the character X

# Evaluation Quiz

0. How do you add or modify properties of an existing object in JavaScript?

By assigning a new value to the property using dot notation or bracket notation
By using the Object.assign() method
By using the Object.defineProperty() method

2. What is a closure in JavaScript?

A way to define private variables and functions

3. How do you inherit an object from another object in JavaScript?

Using the Object.create() method

4. Why is variable type and scope important in JavaScript?

It determines how memory is allocated and managed
It affects the behavior and functionality of the code
It helps catch errors and bugs during runtime

5. What is the purpose of the Object.create() method in JavaScript?

To create a new object with a specified prototype object

6. How do you access properties and methods of an object in JavaScript?

Using dot notation (object.property)
Using bracket notation (object['property'])

7. How do you create an object in JavaScript?

Using the function keyword
